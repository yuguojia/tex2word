# Changelog

All notable changes to **tex2word** are recorded here. tex2word converts LaTeX
to editable Word (`.docx`) with native OMML math and live fields; see
[`README.md`](README.md) for the feature overview.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 1.0.6 — problem sheets, cheatsheets & plain-TeX math

Support for real-world problem-sheet and cheatsheet documents (a new UAT
bundle: ProblemSet, ams-article, exam/homework sheets, the Oxford
`oxmathproblems` class, TikZ cheatsheets, and a résumé), driven by the gaps
those documents surfaced.

### Added

- **`exam` document class.** `questions`/`parts`/`subparts` environments and
  `\question`/`\miquestion`/`\part`/`\subpart` markers (with an optional
  `[points]`) render as nested numbered lists, instead of colliding with
  `\part` sectioning (which produced garbage like "Part I D"). A question that
  leads straight into its `\parts` still gets its own number above the
  `(a)/(b)/(c)` sub-items. Solutions are hidden unless `\printanswers` is set,
  matching the compiled sheet. The Oxford-style title block is recovered from
  `\course`/`\sheetnumber`/`\oxfordterm`/`\sheettitle`.
- **TikZ "cheatsheet" content boxes.** The idiom of `\node{…minipage…}` content
  boxes plus a `\node[fancytitle]{Title}` (no drawing primitives) has its text
  and math recovered — titles become headings — rather than being dropped as an
  empty graphics placeholder when no TeX engine is present. Real diagrams (with
  `\draw`/`\fill`/…) are still routed to the image/compile path untouched.
- **Plain-TeX math.** `\halign` systems of equations inside `\[ … \]` (wrapped
  in `\centerline{\hbox{\vbox{\openup…\jot …}}}`) convert to an `array`; `\cr`
  is treated as a matrix/array row separator; the math-class wrappers
  `\mathbin`/`\mathrel`/`\mathop`/`\mathord`/`\mathopen`/`\mathclose`/
  `\mathpunct`/`\mathinner` render their content transparently (they only affect
  spacing).
- **Symbols.** Normal-subgroup relations (`\vartriangleleft`/`\trianglelefteq`/
  `\ntrianglelefteq`/…), `\nmid`/`\nparallel`/`\smallsetminus`, and the
  restriction/harpoon glyphs (`\restriction`/`\upharpoonright`/…). The `\/`
  italic correction is a silent no-op.

## Unreleased

- **`\texwordstyle{body}{…}` restyles ordinary body text (正文).** A new role sets
  the paragraph style of plain body-text paragraphs, previously hardcoded to
  `Normal`: `\texwordstyle{body}{正文缩进}` makes 正文 use an indented
  `normal-indent`-style from the `--reference-doc` template instead of `Normal`.
  Only top-level body paragraphs are affected — math, captions, list items, TOC,
  and other `Normal`-based paragraphs keep their styles.
- **Display-math rendering matches Word's native equation layout.** Several
  fixes to the LaTeX→OMML path bring numbered equations in line with what Word
  itself produces:
  - **Operators, digits and symbols keep their math spacing.** Operators (`=`,
    `+`, …), digits and symbol glyphs were tagged `m:nor` (normal text), which
    stripped the relational/binary-operator spacing so `a=b+c` rendered cramped
    and lowercase Greek came out upright. They are now plain math runs, so Word
    spaces them and italicises variables (lowercase Greek included) correctly.
  - **n-ary operators bind their operand.** `\int_\gamma f` / `\sum_k a_k b_k`
    now carry the integrand/summand inside the operator (OMML `m:e`), capturing
    up to the next relation or `+`/`-` sign, instead of leaving the body empty
    with the operand floating after it.
  - **Numbered equations number inside the math zone.** A numbered equation is
    now an `m:eqArr` (with `m:maxDist`) inside `m:oMathPara`, with the number
    parked at the right margin by the `#` separator — the native Word numbered-
    equation layout — replacing the previous paragraph-tab + trailing-field
    scheme. `align`/`eqnarray` lines align at their `&` (now `m:aln` marks) and
    each keep their own number. The reader recovers this structure back to
    LaTeX (`&`, `\\`, and the equation label).
  - **Upright *math* uses the plain style, not normal-text.** `\mathrm`,
    `\operatorname`, `\symup`/`\uppi` and function names now emit `m:sty="p"`
    (upright math, keeps math spacing); genuine text (`\text`/`\textrm`/`\mbox`/
    `\textbf`) still uses `m:nor`.
- **`--reference-doc` can target a specific section's page geometry + headers/footers
  via a `tex2word_section` bookmark.** A reference template's page size, margins and
  running headers/footers are lifted from its body section. Previously we always
  took the document's *final* section, but a multi-section template (e.g. a thesis
  template) commonly leaves that last section bare — its running headers/footers
  live on the main-text sections — so nothing was carried and the output had no
  headers/footers. A template author can now drop a bookmark named
  `tex2word_section` on any paragraph of the page they want adopted (in Word:
  Insert → Bookmark → name `tex2word_section` → Add); we lift the section that
  governs that paragraph instead. Header/footer types and `pgSz`/`pgMar` the marked
  section doesn't state itself are inherited from the nearest preceding section,
  mirroring Word's section inheritance (so marking a section that only overrides the
  default header still carries the inherited first/even ones). Without the bookmark
  the behaviour is unchanged — the final section is used.
- **`--reference-doc` now carries the template's advanced/compatibility options.**
  The reference document's `word/settings.xml` is adopted, so options like the
  `w:compat` flags (e.g. `doNotExpandShiftReturn` — "don't expand character spacing
  on a line that ends with Shift+Enter"), `w:characterSpacingControl`,
  `w:defaultTabStop`, `w:mathPr` and the drawing-grid/kerning settings now survive
  conversion instead of being reset to tex2word's minimal defaults. We strip only
  what would break the output — `w:attachedTemplate` and any relationship-bearing
  element (we don't carry `settings.xml.rels`, so these would dangle) and
  `w:writeProtection` / `w:documentProtection` (which would lock the document
  against editing) — and re-insert `w:updateFields` at its canonical position so
  Word still recalculates `SEQ`/`REF` fields on first open. Without a reference doc
  the built-in minimal settings are unchanged.
- **`--reference-doc` now carries the template's footnotes/endnotes separators.**
  A template's `settings.xml` references its footnote/endnote separator and
  continuation-separator definitions (`<w:footnote>`/`<w:endnote>` ids `-1`/`0`),
  which live in `footnotes.xml`/`endnotes.xml`. We now carry those parts so the
  references resolve — previously they were dropped, so a document with no notes
  of its own opened with Word reporting unreadable footnote/endnote content and
  offering to repair (adding `脚注1`/`尾注1`). We keep only the separator /
  continuation-separator notes — the template's own body footnotes (ids ≥ 1, which
  also carry the relationships) are dropped — and when the converted document has
  its own notes we use the template's separators with our content notes. The
  validator now also flags a notes-separator reference whose backing part is
  missing.
- **Fixed: English text rendered in the Chinese font for CJK documents.** The
  document language was written to `w:lang`'s `w:val` attribute, which is the
  *Latin*-script proofing language; for an East-Asian language (zh/ja/ko) that
  made Word treat ASCII runs as East-Asian and render them in the `eastAsia` font
  (so English appeared in 宋体). East-Asian languages now go to `w:eastAsia`
  while `w:val` stays a Latin language (defaulting to `en-US`), so Latin text
  keeps the Latin font. Western languages are unaffected.
- **Localisable caption / cross-reference wording (`--caption-locale`).** Captions
  and `\cref`/`\eqref` prefixes can now read in Chinese: a new `--caption-locale`
  flag (`auto` / `en` / `zh-CN`) switches the displayed label word (`Figure`→`图`,
  `Table`→`表`, `Equation`→`公式`, `Algorithm`→`算法`), the chapter/number separator
  (so `--number-by-section` renders `图1-1` instead of `Figure 1.1`), the delimiter
  before the caption text (full-width space `　`), and the cleveref prefixes.
  `auto` (the default) selects Chinese when the document language is `zh-CN` *or* a
  CJK font is set (`\setCJKmainfont` etc.). Language detection now also recognises
  ctex (`\documentclass{ctexart|ctexrep|ctexbook}` or `\usepackage{ctex}`) as
  `zh-CN`, which both drives `auto` and sets Word's proofing language correctly.
  The underlying Word `SEQ` counter names
  stay English, so live numbering and `\ref` keep matching. Fine-grained overrides
  come from `\texwordcaption{key}{value}` directives in the source (values are used
  verbatim, so surrounding spaces are significant):

  | key | overrides | example value | effect |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | `figurelabel` | figure label word | `图` | `图1-1` |
  | `tablelabel` | table label word | `表` | `表1-1` |
  | `equationlabel` | equation label word | `公式` | (used by `\cref`) |
  | `algorithmlabel` | algorithm label word | `算法` | `算法1-1` |
  | `labelsep` | gap between label and number | `` (empty) | `图1` vs `Figure 1` |
  | `sectionsep` | chapter/number separator | `.` | `图1.1` instead of `图1-1` |
  | `delim` | text before the caption | `：` | `图1-1：说明` |
  | `eqopen` / `eqclose` | equation parentheses | `（` / `）` | `（1-1）` |

  ```latex
  % make a zh-CN document number figures 图1.1 (dot) and use a Chinese colon:
  \texwordcaption{sectionsep}{.}
  \texwordcaption{delim}{：}
  % full-width parentheses for equation numbers:
  \texwordcaption{eqopen}{（}\texwordcaption{eqclose}{）}
  ```

  Under pdfLaTeX add `\providecommand{\texwordcaption}[2]{}` so the directive is a
  no-op there (same as `\texwordstyle`). Convert with `--number-by-section` to get
  the `N-M` / `N.M` chapter-numbered form.
- **`\texwordstyle` now styles table text and three-line tables (三线表).** Two new
  roles: `\texwordstyle{table}{…}` sets the paragraph style of the text inside every
  table cell (previously hardcoded to `Normal`), so cell text need not be `Normal`;
  and `\texwordstyle{threelinetable}{…}` names a Word *table* style that is applied
  to any tabular whose first command is `\toprule` (a booktabs three-line table).
  When that role is bound, the matching table adopts the named table style and we
  drop our default full-grid borders so the template's three-line border format
  takes effect; tabulars that are not three-line tables, or when the role is left
  unbound, keep the existing full grid. Both names resolve against the
  `--reference-doc` template and fall back (to `Normal` / no table style) when unbound.
- **`--reference-doc` now adopts the template's list numbering.** Previously only
  `styles.xml`, the theme, page geometry and headers/footers were lifted from a
  reference template, while list/heading numbering kept tex2word's built-in
  scheme — so a template's custom multilevel list (多级列表) and bullet/numbered
  list formats were ignored. We now carry the template's `numbering.xml`, detect
  its bullet list, ordered list and heading-linked multilevel list, and remap our
  fixed bullet/decimal/heading numIds onto them (each falling back to the bundled
  definition when the template lacks that role). Heading-linked levels keep their
  `w:pStyle` binding across the styleId normalization.
- **`\texwordstyle{role}{Word style name}` binds appendix/part to template styles.**
  Appendix headings and `\part` have no distinguishing marker for auto-detection,
  so a new source directive maps them explicitly: `\texwordstyle{appendix1}{附录一}`
  ..`{appendix4}{…}` and `\texwordstyle{part}{…}`. The named style is resolved
  against the `--reference-doc` template (by display name, not a hardcoded id);
  matching appendix/`\part` headings then adopt that paragraph style, and their
  numbering (numId 4/5) points at the multilevel list the template links to it.
  Unresolved names warn and fall back to the built-in Heading style + numbering.
- **`\texwordstyle` also styles figures and captions.** `\texwordstyle{figure}{…}`
  sets the paragraph style of the line that holds an inserted image (including
  rendered TikZ and sub-figure images). `\texwordstyle{caption}{…}` sets the
  default caption style, overridable per type by `figurecaption`, `tablecaption`,
  `subfigurecaption` and `algorithmcaption`. All resolve the named style against
  the `--reference-doc` template and fall back to `Normal` / `Caption` when unbound.
- **`\texwordstyle` covers the common paragraph styles, with name auto-discovery.**
  `title`, `subtitle`, `abstract`, `sourcecode`, `quote`, `bibliography` and
  `footnote` can now be rebound too. And the default behaviour changed: when a role
  is left *unbound*, tex2word first looks for a style of that name in the
  `--reference-doc` template and adopts it, only falling back to the bundled
  built-in style if none is found — so e.g. a template's own `Abstract` or
  `Source Code` paragraph style is now picked up automatically, without a directive.
  Name resolution follows the styleId normalization the styles merge applies, so a
  discovered id is always valid in the merged styles.

  **All `\texwordstyle` roles**

  | role | styles | bound via |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `appendix1`..`appendix4` | appendix heading levels 1–4 (style + linked numbering) | explicit only |
  | `part` | `\part` heading (style + linked numbering) | explicit only |
  | `figure` | the paragraph holding an inserted image / TikZ / sub-figure image | explicit only |
  | `caption` | default caption style for all caption kinds | explicit only |
  | `figurecaption` | figure captions (overrides `caption`) | explicit only |
  | `tablecaption` | table captions (overrides `caption`) | explicit only |
  | `subfigurecaption` | sub-figure `(a)`/`(b)` captions (overrides `caption`) | explicit only |
  | `algorithmcaption` | algorithm captions (overrides `caption`) | explicit only |
  | `title` | document title | explicit or name auto-discovery |
  | `subtitle` | author / affiliation / date lines | explicit or name auto-discovery |
  | `abstract` | abstract + keywords paragraphs | explicit or name auto-discovery |
  | `sourcecode` | verbatim / listings / inline code blocks | explicit or name auto-discovery |
  | `quote` | quote / quotation blocks | explicit or name auto-discovery |
  | `bibliography` | reference-list entries | explicit or name auto-discovery |
  | `footnote` | footnote / endnote text | explicit or name auto-discovery |
  | `body` | ordinary body-text (正文) paragraphs (default `Normal`) | explicit only |
  | `table` | text inside table cells (default `Normal`) | explicit only |
  | `threelinetable` | Word *table* style for a 三线表 (tabular whose first command is `\toprule`) | explicit only |

  Add `\providecommand{\texwordstyle}[2]{}` so pdflatex ignores the directive.

## 1.0.5 — TikZ preamble fix

- **TikZ compile no longer broken by a multi-line preamble macro.** The
  standalone-figure preamble filter was line-based, so it kept only the opening
  line of a multi-line `\newcommand{\box}[3]{ … }` and left an unbalanced `{` —
  corrupting the preamble and making **every** TikZ figure's compile fail. It now
  captures the full brace-balanced definition. (A `remember picture, overlay`
  page-overlay picture — a logo/watermark referencing `current page` — still
  can't be built as a standalone figure and degrades to a placeholder; that is
  inherent, not a preamble bug.)

## 1.0.4 — multi-column layout + code-review fixes

### Added

- **Multi-column body layout.** `\documentclass[twocolumn]` (and `\twocolumn` /
  `multicols{N}`) is detected and the body flows in N Word columns; the
  `--columns N` flag / `columns=` argument still overrides. A **starred float**
  (`figure*`/`table*`) and the **title/abstract** span the full page width,
  realised with continuous section breaks that switch the column count around
  each spanning region. *Limitation:* a mid-document `\onecolumn`/`\twocolumn`
  switch is not modelled — the largest column count seen applies to the whole
  body.

### Fixed

- **Misplaced environment star normalized.** The common typo `\begin*{figure}` /
  `\end*{figure}` (the star belongs on the name: `\begin{figure*}`) is now
  normalized, so such floats are still recognized as spanning and don't leak a
  spurious `\caption` warning.

Fixes from an in-depth code review of the 1.0.2/1.0.3 changes.

- **`\iffalse … \else … \fi` keeps the `\else` branch.** The block remover dropped
  *both* branches; it now drops only the false branch and preserves the `\else`
  branch, with nested `\else` correctly scoped to its own conditional.
- **Aligned math matrices pad ragged rows.** An `aligned`/`align` block with a
  short line declared N columns but emitted fewer cells on that row, producing a
  ragged `m:m` that Word could misrender; every row is now padded to the column
  count.
- **`\multicolumn`+`\multirow` cells merge with the correct width.** A cell that
  was both spanned the wrong number of columns on its `vMerge` continuation rows
  (it used the next row's cell width); the originating colspan is now tracked.
- **Nested single-column `tabular` with block content is no longer flattened.**
  The line-stacking flatten dropped non-paragraph blocks (display math, nested
  lists); such cells now keep their content instead of silently losing it.
- **Robustness:** code-listing `[options]` and `\DeclareMathOperator` bodies now
  tolerate two levels of nested braces (`[caption={\textbf{C}}]`,
  `\mathbb{\mathcal{E}}}`); the math env-delimiter scanner is bounds-safe at
  end-of-string (and de-duplicated into one helper).

## 1.0.3 — generated colour-table support

Continued real-paper robustness, driven by a generated-colour-table paper
(arXiv:2606.24775) whose taxonomy table couldn't convert.

- **`\ding{N}` (pifont dingbats) now render as Unicode.** Check/cross marks and
  the circled-digit ranges (`\ding{182}` → ❶, …) — used as level markers all
  over generated tables — were dropped as an unsupported macro; they now map to
  the matching Unicode glyph.
- **`\multirow` nested inside `\multicolumn` is unwrapped.** Generated colour
  tables write `\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\multirow{-2}{*}{…}}`; both wrappers are now
  peeled so the content survives (no warning) and both the column span
  (`w:gridSpan`) and row span (`w:vMerge`) are captured. A negative row span
  (`\multirow{-N}`, content anchored in the bottom row) keeps its content without
  attempting a top-down merge.
- **Single-column nested `tabular` line-stacking flattens to line breaks.** The
  `\begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}}a\\b\end{tabular}` idiom inside a cell became a nested
  table *per cell*; it now flattens to one paragraph with line breaks (one table
  instead of dozens).
- **`\shortstack{a \\ b}`** renders as stacked lines.
- **`\iffalse … \fi` blocks are dropped.** Content commented out with this TeX
  conditional (often whole sections) was wrongly included; nested `\if…`/`\fi`
  are tracked so the matching `\fi` closes the block.
- **User `\newtcolorbox` callout environments** (e.g. a paper's `findingbox`)
  render as set-off quote blocks instead of an "unknown environment" warning.
- **ACM front-matter macros** (`\country`/`\city`/`\institution`/`\authornote`/…)
  are consumed instead of leaking their arguments as body text.

## 1.0.2 — real-paper robustness (macros, theorems, tables, cross-refs)

A robustness pass driven by real arXiv papers whose custom preambles and tables
sent content to the lossy fallback path. Highlights: local-package macro/theorem
collection, alignment-environment and operator math fixes, `\multirow`, and
cross-references to list items. Also hardens TikZ compilation against
shell-escape injection.

- **Cross-references to `enumerate` items now resolve.** An `\item\label{rq:x}`
  attaches to the list item, and `\ref{rq:x}` emits a live `REF \r` field that
  returns the item's auto-numbered list number (so `RQ\ref{rq:x}` renders
  "RQ2"). Previously the label was dropped and the reference rendered as `??`.
- **Custom `\newtheorem` environments defined in a local package now work.**
  Declarations split into a `\usepackage`d local `.sty` (a paper's
  `MyPreamble.sty`) were never collected, so `\begin{THM}…` was treated as an
  unknown/transparent environment with no "Theorem N" heading and broke every
  `\ref` to it. Those `.sty` sources are now scanned; wrapped display titles
  (`\newtheorem{THM}{\textbf{Theorem}}`) are cleaned to "Theorem"; and a shared
  counter (`\newtheorem{LEM}[THM]{Lemma}`) now numbers against the shared
  environment, so THM/LEM/PRP/… form one running sequence as in LaTeX.
- **`\multirow{n}*{content}` (unbraced `*` width).** The common form where the
  width is written as a bare `*` instead of `{*}` left only two brace groups and
  fell through to an "unsupported inline macro" warning that dropped the cell.
  It now sets the row span (`w:vMerge`) and keeps the content.
- **`\beginappendix`** (and other class wrappers around `\appendix`) switch later
  sections to lettered appendix numbering instead of warning as unsupported.
- **Unbraced single-token `\newcommand` bodies now expand.** The idiom
  `\newcommand\CAL\mathcal` (unbraced name *and* unbraced control-sequence body,
  e.g. `\BE\textbf`, `\BB\mathbb`, `\RM\mathrm`) was silently dropped, so the
  alias leaked into the output and any math using it fell back to raw LaTeX.
- **`\DeclareMathOperator` with a braced body / in a local package.** A body
  containing a group such as `\DeclareMathOperator*{\Exp}{\mathbb{E}}` was not
  rewritten (the scan stopped at the inner brace), and operators declared inside
  a `\usepackage`d local `.sty` weren't harvested at all — both left the operator
  undefined and sent the formula to raw. They now convert to native OMML.
- **`\qedhere` in display math is dropped.** amsthm's end-of-proof QED-placement
  command has no OMML equivalent; it was aborting the whole block to raw.
- **`align`/`align*`/`gather`/… wrapped in display or `\left\{…\right.` now render
  fully.** When one of these alignment environments appeared *inside* `\[…\]`,
  `$$…$$`, or a `\left\{…\right.` system, the math parser didn't recognise it and
  the fallback path silently dropped almost all the content (a braced system
  could render as just `{`). They're now parsed as column-aligned matrices, and
  they keep the classic `array{rl}` justification (relation signs line up at the
  `&`) — matching the multi-line display path, which previously diverged.
- **TikZ rendering hardened against shell-escape injection.** The standalone
  compile now runs the TeX engine with `-no-shell-escape` (and `shell_escape=f`/
  `openout_any=p` in the environment), so a malicious `\write18`/`\immediate`
  in a figure's source can't execute shell commands during conversion.
- **booktabs `\cmidrule(lr){2-3}` in math arrays.** The optional `(l/r/lr)` trim
  modifier is now consumed alongside the `{a-b}` span, instead of leaking `(lr)`
  into the rendered matrix.
- **Code-listing options with braced brackets.** An `[options]` value such as
  `[caption={[Fig.1] x}]` (a `]` nested inside a braced value) no longer
  truncates the option scan at the inner `]` and leak `}]` plus the code as a
  runaway listing.
- **Array/table rules in math no longer abort the block.** `\hline` (and
  `\cline`/`\toprule`/`\midrule`/`\bottomrule`/`\hdashline`) inside a math
  `array`/matrix have no OMML equivalent and were raising MathUnsupported,
  dumping the whole block to raw `\[ … \]`. They're now dropped, so block
  matrices with rules (and the `|` column separators around them) convert.

## 1.0.1 — alignment-environment math fixes

- **Alignment environments in display math now convert.** A bare
  `\begin{aligned}`/`gathered`/`split`/`multlined` block (no `$$`/`\[`, as real
  copy-pasted/OCR'd papers often have) was parsed as text, leaking `\frac`/`\int`
  as raw inline; these are now treated as display math. And `aligned`/`array`
  wrapped in `$$…$$` or `\[…\]` no longer falls back to raw — the block splitter
  is `\begin…\end`-aware, so a `\\`/`&` inside an environment isn't mistaken for a
  line/column separator and the whole environment is parsed directly.
- **Release safeguard.** The `release.yml` build now fails fast if the pushed git
  tag (`vX.Y.Z`) doesn't match `pyproject`'s version, preventing a stale-tag
  publish of the wrong/duplicate version.

## 1.0.0 — first stable release

tex2word reaches **1.0**: a production-grade, cross-platform LaTeX → editable
Word (`.docx`) converter with native OMML math, live auto-renumbering fields,
CJK/XeLaTeX support, TikZ figure rendering, and a robustness pass driven by real
books. Published on PyPI as `tex2word` (MIT).

### TikZ / PGF figures rendered to images
- A figure whose content is a `tikzpicture`/`pgfpicture`/… is compiled with an
  available TeX engine (tries `xelatex` → `lualatex` → `pdflatex` until one
  produces a PDF, so partial installs still work), cropped via `standalone`, and
  rasterised to PNG with the `pdf` extra. The document preamble is filtered to
  the parts a picture needs. Without a usable toolchain the figure degrades to
  **caption-only** (no developer-facing "figure omitted" placeholder), and the
  report says exactly why (no engine / missing `tex2word[pdf]` / compile error).

### Real-document robustness (found converting a `ctexbook` + `xeCJK` book)
- **Code listings no longer swallow the document.** A `$` in `lstlisting`/
  `minted` code (R's `df$col`) used to open math mode and run to end of file.
  These are normalised to `verbatim`, dropping `[options]`/minted `{lang}` —
  and this now applies to listings pulled in via `\input`/`\include` too (the
  flattening was reordered to run first).
- **Old-style font declarations** — `{\bfseries …}`/`{\bf …}`/`{\it}`/`{\tt}`
  (incl. unbraced block-level use) now apply instead of leaking `\bf` literally;
  and inside math `{\rm Lik}` is honoured like `\mathrm{…}` (it used to dump the
  whole `align*` block to raw `\[ … \]`).
- **Block-level (unbraced) `\color`/font declarations** are scoped to the run of
  inlines that follow, like the braced form.
- **Layout/front-matter commands dropped** — `\begingroup`/`\endgroup`,
  `\AddToShipoutPicture{\put…}`, `\newcounter{}[]` no longer leak (cover pages).
- **`\text`/`\mbox` outside math** render their argument instead of leaking.

## 0.9.1 — CJK support (XeLaTeX/xeCJK)

- **CJK support (XeLaTeX/xeCJK).** `\setmainfont`, `\setCJKmainfont`,
  `\setCJKsansfont` and `\setCJKmonofont` are detected from the preamble and
  applied to the Word styles: the Latin font becomes the `ascii`/`hAnsi` default
  and the CJK font the `eastAsia` default (in `docDefaults`), with the CJK sans
  font on heading/title styles and the CJK mono font on Source Code — so CJK text
  renders in the intended font. CJK inside math (`\text{…}`/`\mbox{…}`) is also
  tagged with the East-Asian font on its OMML runs, so formula CJK renders in the
  CJK font instead of a fallback. The choices round-trip back to a XeLaTeX
  preamble. Tested for Chinese in tables, formulas, headings, lists and footnotes
  (`test_cjk_context.py`), plus a LibreOffice render smoke gated on a CI lane that
  installs LibreOffice + `fonts-wqy-zenhei` (`test_cjk_render.py`).

## 0.9.0 — broader LaTeX coverage

Folds in a large batch of front-end coverage and fidelity work, with the test
suite roughly doubling (now 715 tests passing). Highlights from the new tests:
hyperref/`\nameref`, `\index`, glossary entries & `\printglossary`, `csquotes`
(inline + block) and `\enquote`, `endnotes`, `\marginpar`, `epigraph`,
`wrapfigure`, `\substack`, `\nicefrac`, `siunitx` ranges, `\DeclareMathOperator`,
`\lstinline`/`\lstinputlisting`, ORCID author metadata, running heads, language
detection, and more. Packaging is unchanged (MIT, published as `tex2word`).

- **UAT fixtures committed.** The real-paper acceptance suites
  (`tests/uat/arXiv-…`) now ship with the repo, so CI runs the full suite
  (the previous UAT exclusions in `ci.yml` are removed).
- Added `tests/conftest.py`, a `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, and `.python-version`.

## 0.8.2 — rename to `tex2word`

- **Renamed the package `latex2word` → `tex2word`.** The import package
  (`import tex2word`), the CLI command (`tex2word convert`), and the source tree
  (`src/tex2word/`) are now all `tex2word`, matching the PyPI distribution —
  there is a separate, unrelated `latex2word` project on PyPI to avoid. The
  `[tool.uv.build-backend] module-name` override added in 0.8.1 is no longer
  needed and was removed.
- **Fixed `tex2word --help`.** An unescaped `%` in the `benchmark` subcommand's
  help text crashed argparse (`unsupported format character`); now escaped.

## 0.8.1 — PyPI packaging & release tooling

First public PyPI release. No functional changes to the converter — this release
makes the project installable from PyPI and publishable from CI.

- **Distribution published as `tex2word`.** The PyPI distribution name was set to
  `tex2word` (matching the repository); the import package and CLI command were
  still `latex2word` at this point, with `[tool.uv.build-backend] module-name`
  pointing the build backend at the module. The full rename lands in 0.8.2.
- **MIT licensed.** Added a top-level [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and PEP 639 metadata
  (`license = "MIT"` + `license-files`).
- **Complete packaging metadata.** Author/maintainer, `readme`, keywords, trove
  classifiers, and project URLs (Homepage/Repository/Issues/Changelog).
- **Documented install extras.** `pip install "tex2word[pdf,mathml,csl,mathimg]"`.
- **CI workflow.** ruff + mypy + pytest on Python 3.12 and 3.13, plus an
  sdist/wheel build gated by `twine check`.
- **Release workflow.** Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag builds and publishes to PyPI via
  Trusted Publishing (OIDC — no stored token) and cuts a GitHub release. Actions
  pinned to the Node-24 majors (`actions/checkout@v5`, `astral-sh/setup-uv@v6`).
- **Docs.** Fixed broken internal links, corrected the author line, and added
  PyPI install instructions to the README.

## 0.8.0 — templates, collaboration round-trip & class breadth

The v3 arc's first cut: adopt Word templates, round-trip Word reviews (tracked
changes + comments), deepen reconcile, and broaden document-class/bibliography
support — plus a permissive (zero-GPL) dependency posture. 531 tests, ruff +
mypy clean.

- **biblatex support (V5-11).** `\addbibresource{refs.bib}` (preamble or body) +
  `\printbibliography` are now recognised alongside the classic
  `\bibliography`/`bibtex` flow, so biblatex documents get their citations and
  reference list resolved.
- **Structured title blocks: authors, affiliations, keywords (V5-10).**
  `\author{A \and B \and C}` yields **one author per `\and`**; `\institute` /
  `\affiliation` / `\affil` / `\address` / `\email` render as **affiliation
  lines**; `\inst{n}` / `\IEEEauthorrefmark{n}` become superscript markers;
  IEEEtran `\IEEEauthorblockN`/`\IEEEauthorblockA` content is preserved; and
  `\keywords` / `\IEEEkeywords` render a **Keywords** line. All work in the
  preamble or body and round-trip.
- **Semantic round-trip tags for bibliography & figures (V5-4).** The reference
  list and each figure are emitted inside tagged block content controls
  (`w:sdt`), so the round-trip reader recovers them as one `ir.Bibliography` /
  `ir.Figure` — a **sub-figure grid now round-trips as a Figure instead of a
  table** (closes root-cause C3), and the reference text is preserved. The reader
  also **descends into any Word content control**, so content inside
  template/field controls is no longer dropped.
- **Original label names restored on read-back (V5-5).** Sanitised Word bookmarks
  map back to the source label keys: with a manifest, `to_latex` builds an exact
  bookmark→key map (so `\ref` keys are the originals); without one, a heuristic
  reverses common cross-ref prefixes (`eq_e` → `eq:e`, `sec_intro` → `sec:intro`)
  and leaves unknown prefixes untouched.
- **Inline reconcile for mixed paragraphs (V5-5).** A prose edit in a paragraph
  that also contains inline **math** (or footnotes/images) is now merged
  *inline*: the edited words are taken from Word while the **exact manifest
  LaTeX** of the math/footnote/image is kept (no lossy OMML round-trip). It
  splits both paragraphs at their semantic nodes, takes a prose segment from Word
  only where it actually changed, and **falls back to the manifest** paragraph
  whenever it can't merge safely (a `Ref`/`Cite` whose rendering injects prose, a
  changed/extra semantic node) — so unedited paragraphs round-trip to identity.
- **`\todo` → Word comments (V5-3, forward).** `\todo{…}` (todonotes) and
  `\comment`/`\note` (changes) become native Word **review comments**
  (`comments.xml` + anchors), so notes written in LaTeX show up in the Word
  reviewing pane. Completes the comment round-trip loop (LaTeX `\todo` → Word
  comment → back to a `% comment:` line, without duplication through reconcile).
- **Recover Word comments (V5-3).** Review comments (`comments.xml`) are read at
  their anchors and surfaced in LaTeX as `% comment: [author] …` lines, so a
  reviewer's notes aren't lost on the way back. Comments are newline-wrapped so
  they never comment out real text, and they **survive reconcile** — a note on an
  otherwise-unchanged paragraph is grafted onto the kept manifest block.
- **Accept Word tracked changes on read (V5-3).** Reading a `.docx` now accepts
  Track Changes: inserted runs (`w:ins`/`w:moveTo`) are kept, deleted runs
  (`w:del`/`w:moveFrom`) are dropped. So a document a co-author reviewed in Word
  with Track Changes round-trips back to LaTeX as if every change were accepted —
  including through reconcile.
- **Reference Word templates (V5-1).** `tex2word convert … --reference-doc
  TEMPLATE.docx` adopts a journal's or organisation's Word template: the output
  uses the template's **styles** (its `Heading 1`/`Title`/`Caption`/… win;
  tex2word's custom styles like `SourceCode` are merged in so nothing renders
  unstyled), its **theme** (fonts/colours), its **page geometry** (size +
  margins), and its **headers/footers** (running titles + page numbers, **plus
  header/footer logos** — PNG/JPEG/EMF images are carried and namespaced under
  `media/tmpl/`; a part with an unsupported/missing sub-resource is skipped so no
  relationship dangles) — while keeping our live `SEQ`/`REF`/`TOC` fields intact.
  An unreadable reference warns and falls back to the built-in styles.
- **No GPL/AGPL dependencies.** The optional `pdf` extra's PDF rasteriser was
  swapped from **PyMuPDF (AGPL-3.0)** to **pypdfium2 (Apache-2.0/BSD, Google
  PDFium)** + Pillow — both permissive. `backend/raster.py` and the
  `render_check` PDF inspector now use PDFium; tests author fixture PDFs with
  matplotlib. tex2word is now MIT with only Apache-2.0/BSD/MIT/PSF/HPND deps on
  every install path.

## 0.7.0 — round-trip reconcile by default

Word→LaTeX reconcile is now the default, with a signature-stable + edit-safe
merge; the LaTeXML front-end runs end-to-end; the foreign-docx reader recovers
every structured block. 487 tests, ruff + mypy clean.

- **Round-trip reconcile is on by default.** `to_latex` now merges Word edits
  against the manifest by default (was opt-in). A **manifest-biased anchored
  merge** makes it both *signature-stable* — an unedited `.docx` reconciles to
  **identity** (byte-for-byte the original LaTeX; all 7 corpus/UAT docs, CI-gated)
  — and *edit-safe*: prose edits are picked up, but a lossless manifest block is
  never replaced by a lossy read-back. Supporting work: prose-only / synonym-
  folded / citation-artifact-stripped block signatures, `Table N:` caption and
  `Abstract` recovery in the reader, and a `book`-flag fix in the merge path.
  Pass `--no-reconcile` (CLI) / `reconcile=False` for the manifest verbatim.
- **LaTeXML front-end now runs end-to-end (V4-3).** Fixed the silent fallback:
  `run_latexml` wrote to `--dest=-`, which this LaTeXML treats as a *filename*
  (not stdout), so it captured 0 bytes and always fell back to the pure parser.
  It now writes to a temp file and reads it back; the advisory `real-tool` CI
  lane confirms `--frontend latexml` converts all five corpus docs
  (`latexml-ok`), each schema-valid. Still **experimental** (the pure parser
  stays the validated default).
- **Reader recovers algorithm boxes and description lists (V4-16).** The
  foreign-docx reader now maps an `Algorithm N:` ruled box (single-cell table of
  `SourceCode` lines) back to `ir.Algorithm` (caption/label, per-line indent and
  line numbers recovered), and an indented bold-term + definition paragraph back
  to a `description` `ir.ItemList`. With **every structured block now
  recovered**, the round-trip reconcile path is ready to flip on by default.

## 0.6.2 — round-trip depth, perf, tooling

The v2 "tail": reader recovery, performance, citations, packaging, and a
quantitative baseline. 470 tests, ruff + mypy clean.

- **Reader recovery (V4-16/17).** The foreign-docx reader now recovers
  **theorems/proofs** (in addition to figures/quotes/code), and field-based
  citations from **Zotero**, **Mendeley** and **EndNote** map back to `\cite`
  (foreign Word equations and tables already round-tripped).
- **Performance (V4-19).** Identical images are embedded once (content-hash media
  dedup), and the image-math fallback is memoised.
- **Quantitative benchmark (V4-4).** `tex2word benchmark <dir>` reports
  math-OMML %, validity, warnings and aborts (text + JSON), with
  `--fail-on-regression`; CI-gated over the corpus + UATs. Baseline: **100%
  native-OMML math, 100% valid, 0 aborts.**
- **Reproducible builds (V4-18).** The manifest timestamp honours
  `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` → byte-identical output.
- **Packaging (V4-20).** `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and a tag-driven PyPI
  `Release` workflow (Trusted Publishing).
- **Front-end honesty.** The default **`pure`** parser is the validated engine;
  `--frontend latexml` is marked **experimental** — an advisory `real-tool` CI
  lane (V4-3) showed it silently falls back, so it is not yet proven end-to-end.

## 0.6.1 — fidelity fixes (real-paper driven)

A patch of forward-conversion fidelity fixes, several driven by a third
real-paper UAT (arXiv:2605.23904v2). 452 tests, ruff + mypy clean.

- **Nested table grids.** A `table*` whose tabular(s) sit inside
  `\resizebox{…}{…}{\begin{minipage}…}` (the "grid of sub-tables" layout) is now
  recovered as real tables instead of dumped as raw LaTeX. `\resizebox`/
  `\scalebox`/`minipage` are transparent containers; block environments inside a
  `{…}` group (e.g. `{\footnotesize \begin{verbatim}…}`) are descended into.
- **`\hphantom`/box macros.** `\phantom`/`\hphantom`/`\vphantom`/`\rule` print
  nothing (no more raw leaks from delta-cell macros); `\mbox`/`\fbox`/`\raisebox`
  emit their content; `\fontsize`/`\selectfont`/`\FloatBarrier`/… are no-ops.
- **`verbatim` bodies.** Fixed an empty-`CodeBlock` bug — code/prompt listings
  (incl. inside a font-size group) now carry their content.
- **Colour `!`-mixes.** `blue!8` is computed (light blue) instead of collapsing
  to base `blue`; `red!40!blue` left-folded.
- **Inline images.** An `\includegraphics` in running text embeds inline (icon/
  logo) instead of forcing a block figure; standalone images stay figures.
- **Round-trip reader.** The foreign-docx reader recovers `Figure`/`Quote`/
  `CodeBlock` blocks (was: flattened to paragraphs).
- **Reproducible builds.** The manifest timestamp honours `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`;
  with it set, output is byte-identical (the ZIP was already deterministic).

## 0.6.0 — v2 "trust & depth"

The v2 arc: earn the fidelity claims with real verification, then deepen math,
document, and citation features. 425 tests, ruff + mypy clean.

### Verification (the v2 headline)
- **ECMA-376 content-model validation (V4-2).** `validate.py` now checks the
  child-ordering of the run/paragraph/table property elements (`w:rPr`/`w:pPr`/
  `w:tblPr`/`w:trPr`/`w:tcPr`) against the schema sequence, plus key enum and
  integer attribute values — offline and CI-gated. It immediately caught and
  fixed 6 real ordering bugs in the shipped `styles.xml`.
- **Visual rendering gate (V4-1).** A blocking CI lane renders the corpus through
  LibreOffice and smoke-checks the PDFs (page count + text) via PyMuPDF —
  appearance-level verification, not just structure. `tex2word.render_check`.

### Math
- **`align`/`aligned` alignment (V4-9).** Multi-line aligned math lines up at the
  `&` (a column-justified matrix); single-numbered `equation`+`aligned` keeps one
  number; numbered top-level `align` keeps per-line numbers.
- **Colour and size on math runs.** `\textcolor{red}{$x$}` and `{\large $x$}` now
  style the equation.
- **`mathtools`/`physics` built-ins (V4-11).** `\abs`/`\norm`/`\ceil`/`\floor`/
  `\set`/`\ket`/`\bra`/`\braket`, `\dv`/`\pdv`/`\dd` — used when not user-defined.
- **`siunitx` (V4-11).** `\si`/`\unit`/`\SI`/`\qty`/`\num`/`\ang` → Unicode units
  and numbers (`\SI{9.81}{\meter\per\second\squared}` → `9.81 m/s²`).

### Document structure
- **Table of contents (V4-12).** `\tableofcontents`/`\listoffigures`/
  `\listoftables` → live Word `TOC` fields.
- **Book structure (V4-15).** Book/report documents make `\chapter` the top
  numbered level (sections nest `1.1.1.1`, `Heading1`–`Heading5`); `\appendix`
  switches to lettered headings (`A`, `A.1`); `\part`, `\frontmatter`/
  `\mainmatter`/`\backmatter` accepted.
- **Glossaries/acronyms (V4-15).** `\newacronym` + `\gls`/`\acrshort`/`\acrlong`/
  `\acrfull` (capitalised/plural variants, first-use full form).
- **Table polish (V4-13).** `\cmidrule`/`\cline` partial rules (incl. the `(lr)`
  trim) → per-cell borders; `>{}` column-alignment processors; nested tables.

### Citations
- **Real CSL engine (V4-14).** Optional `csl` extra (`citeproc-py`): `--csl
  STYLE.csl` formats citations and the reference list against a CSL style, with
  the built-in heuristic as a graceful fallback. `\nocite{key}`/`\nocite{*}`.

### Meta
- `csl` packaging extra; this changelog.

## 0.5.0 — V4 inline/table/math fidelity

The fidelity layer real papers need, on top of the V1–V3 pipeline.

- **Colour.** `\textcolor`/`\color`/`\colorbox`/`\fcolorbox`/`\definecolor`/
  `\colorlet`; `rgb`/`RGB`/`HTML`/`gray`/`cmyk` models + `!`-mixes; composes with
  emphasis; group-scoped.
- **`\includegraphics` options.** `width`/`height`/`scale` (extent), `angle`
  (rotation), `trim`+`clip` (crop); source path as image alt-text.
- **Text spans.** `\textsuperscript`/`\textsubscript` (`w:vertAlign`),
  `\sout`/`\xout` (`w:strike`), `\uline` (underline), `\hl` (`w:highlight`),
  font-size groups `\tiny`…`\Huge` (`w:sz`).
- **Tables.** `\cellcolor`/`\rowcolor` shading (`w:shd`), `p{}` column widths.

Everything round-trips (IR ↔ LaTeX ↔ docx).

## 0.1.0 – 0.4.x — foundation (V1–V3)

Pre-changelog. The `front-end → IR → OOXML` pipeline: native OMML math, live
`SEQ`/`REF`/`PAGEREF`/`STYLEREF` fields, BibTeX→CSL and live Zotero citations,
figures (incl. PDF rasterisation + subfigures), theorems and algorithms, the
Word→LaTeX round-trip, the math decision-cascade + image fallback, the LaTeXML
front-end option, and the embedded round-trip manifest.
